    <h4>LBO Gallery</h4>
    <div>
      <LBOimage src="path/of/image1" gallery="gallery1" title="img-title1" />
      <LBOimage src="path/of/image2" gallery="gallery1" title="img-title2" />
      <LBOimage src="path/of/image3" gallery="gallery1" title="img-title3" />
      <LBOimage src="path/of/image4" gallery="gallery1" title="img-title4" />
    </div>
  </>
)}
